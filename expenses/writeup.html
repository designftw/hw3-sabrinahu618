	<title>Differences between spreadsheet-like app and newer app</title>
	<p> The main differences of this newer app is that it has separate 
		input boxes that gets added to the top of the expense history spreadsheet (to minimize scrolling) instead 
		of adding a blank row at the bottom and then filling in the information. There are two 
		separate sections for Join/Other Person and Self. The newer app also accounts 
		for currency conversion. When the user scrolls down to see the expense history, they can 
		click the Scroll Up button to take them back up to the top. The user can also delete 
		expenses by clicking the X button to the side.
