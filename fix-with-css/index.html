	<h1>Fix the Web with CSS!</h1>
	<h2>1. Safety: Removing the Horizontal Scroll</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Website: https://www.papersource.com/</li>
		<li>CSS code:
			.page-wrapper {
				overflow: hidden;
			}
		</li>
		<li>Safety: Removing the horizontal bar prevents errors and reduces the chances of a slip
			in execution. The horizontal bar was not adding anything 
			functionally to the website and it makes users confused on why it is 
			even there. By using the trackpad to try and scroll left and right, it 
			can accidentally activate the back button. This unintentionally takes the 
			user back to the previous page, which can make them lose their place or progress.
		
		</li>
		<li>Before: <br> <img src="images/paper source before.png" width="450" height="250"></li>
		<li>After: <br> <img src="images/paper source after.png" width="450" height="250"></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2. Learnability: Indicating a Box is Clickable</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Website: https://www.papersource.com/</li>
		<li>CSS code:
			a:hover {
				transform: scale(0.98);
			}
		</li>
		<li>Learnability: The transformation of the box when hovered over acts as a signifier that
			the box is clickable. By using this feature,
			I increased interaction and discoverability so that
			the user knows the box is clickable the first time.
			The user would initially only think
			to click on the SHOP NOW link in the box, but now the SHOP NOW link could be removed from the box.
		</li>
		<li>Before: <br> <img src="images/without hover.png" width="450" height="250"></li>
		<li>After: <br> <video width="450" height="250" controls>
			<source src="images/hover.webm" type="video/webm">
		  </video>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>3. Efficiency: Removing an Extra Click to Quick Links</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Website: https://www.art.yale.edu/</li>
		<li>CSS code:
			element.style {
				empty-cells: hide;
			}
		</li>
		<li>Efficiency: I removed the extra click to view all the Quick Links by hiding 
			the +/- symbol that opens and closes the box. Quick Links should be quick. 
			By directly displaying all of the links and limiting the mechanical steps needed,
			I improved the efficiency of the website.
